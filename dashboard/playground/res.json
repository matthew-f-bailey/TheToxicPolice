are NTA. The phrase \u2018any other woman would kill to have (insert something he did) \u2018 is an abuse tactic. \n\nThis is a very important start to a new stage of relationship and he is intentionally dismissing your clear boundary, blaming you for the embarrassment he felt when you held him accountable, and refusing to propose until you grovel. \n\nIs this a guy you actually want to be with?  Are you ignoring other things you maybe shouldn\u2019t?","1":"YTA. Your wife is trapped at home and it sounds like she\u2019s the sole caregiver and in charge of chores. She has to raise 4 kids all very young, while being pregnant. It\u2019s beyond the soup she probably feels so overwhelmed and trapped. I wonder why y\u2019all are even adding this extra one, look into birth control, especially if money is so tight you can\u2019t fix her car. If that\u2019s the case how are you going to afford this extra kid. I truly feel for your wife, be kind to her. Also do some actual research into pregnancy bro your a father.","2":"NTA.  Don\u2019t feel remotely bad about them possibly being fired.  They deserve it.\n\nAs others have said, check your windows and check for cameras.  They were in areas of your house where they had no need to be and you were distracted trying to find the non-existent cat.","3":"NTA","4":"NTA. Do not marry this man. You would be signing up for a lifetime of expecting him to apologize to you for \\*his\\* mistakes, of embarrassing him for his own appalling behavior, and of having your feelings invalidated and being told you must promise to chill.\n\nGirl, RUN","5":"NTA regardless of how you choose. I think you should take it. It would allow you to give the money back to your mom and grandparents since you won\u2019t need it and use what you saved up for living expenses or a down payment on a house.","6":"NTA. They weren't acting professionally, they stressed you out, were mocking an allergy, and were around being pinecones. They deserve to be reprimanded.","7":"NTA.  Good luck with the mother, she sounds like a very problematic person.","8":"NTA and seriously what they are trying to do could be illegal. In some places it is considered distribution of a controlled substance. Which means you can go to jail for dealing.","9":"NTA.  Being entitled would be demanding that someone already on the bus give up their seat for you.\n\nYou're being the opposite of entitled, you are actually putting in extra effort on your end to guarantee a seat.","10":"NTA. He won\u2019t consider proposing again unless you apologise for his error and promise to do exactly what he wants in future. Do you really want to marry this prick now?","11":"She is asking you to produce a professional-level cake and squawking about having to pay for your labor?\n\nNTA.  She's just trying to cut corners. \n\nShe could get into awful trouble.  If it got out at her company that her child made the cake, and did not get paid for it?  Not a good look.  Might want to let her know that.  Also, what are the legal restrictions on catering where you live?  Could she get into trouble by asking an untrained person to make food for 150 strangers?  Where I live, even if you are a child, you have to take a class that explains how to avoid making people sick before you can sell food that you make, and you have to show the certificate that proves that you passed the class in order to sell the food.  And there are big fines associated with trying to sneak around this law.  By, for example, not paying the baker.","12":"NTA. That's creepy af and they've done it to multiple women. The deserve to be fired, though that probably won't happen. Leave awful reviews for them and tell everyone you know not to use that company.","13":"INFO;  is your dog a normal weight according to your vet?","14":"NTA and moving in with your dad seems like a good idea! The family holiday sounds like a nightmare. As to the plane journey- was your mom drinking or is she always that childish?","15":"Dude owes you money and a bond but you don\u2019t have to take it but you do need the money for the portion you\u2019re short and books and supplies.","16":"NTA. You blindsided them both, just like they blindsided you. You didn\u2019t just marry your husband, you married his mother too. In addressing both of them directly instead of expecting him to talk to his mumma, you have got everything you needed to say out, and he cannot twist it, pretty it up, soften it, lie or change it. You said what you said to their faces directly. Love it \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nPut your foot down, if your husband wants to have his mother live there, he has to pay. But for me, it\u2019s a deal breaker, she\u2019s going to make your life miserable.","17":"NTA, please don\u2019t give your dad your meds. You could be actively feeding an addiction and even if not it\u2019s not worth you risking losing access to the medicine you need. If the doctor sees you\u2019re using much more than needed you could be denied a prescription and have no way of fixing that for a long time.","18":"Nta. You said she was acting ugly. Her mom is starting something with you for her own needs. \n\nI can tell my toddler I love her but I don't like her actions and she understands me. I don't see a big leap from this to that.","19":"NTA.","20":"NTA. You're allowed to have overtime. You're just not allowed to be *paid* for overtime. You know, illegal employment practices.","21":"Take the money; you deserve to get an education from him.\n\nIt doesn't mean you will owe him anything including a relationship.\n\nYou get to choose.\n\nNTA","22":"No way should you pay for ingredients with your own funds.","23":"NTA I would\u2019ve made a police report for intentional food tampering but puking with the door open feels like the less drastic choice so good on you for being so controlled","24":"NTA. Just hearing that combination is enough to make my stomach turn. I have severe allergies and have asthma as well, and when I first started at my current job, the person orienting me caused me to have an asthma attack due to her combined scent of menthol cigarette smoke and the floral body spray she used to try to cover it up. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not the only one bothered by Jay\u2019s scent, and even if you are, that doesn\u2019t give him the right to be pushy. Tbh, I\u2019d report his behavior to HR.","25":"NTA and she may need to seek some therapy to work through whatever it is she\u2019s going through right now","26":"NTA   You should take his money and either save it for after college, or use it to keep your college debts down.  It is the least he can do to make it up to you!","27":"NTA\n\nIf she cuts your hours, quit on the spot (if you are able to, financially). If not, look for a new job immediately.  It's a job-seekers market at the moment.","28":"NTA. Take the money. It will help you with the rest of your expenses down the line","29":"Nta that family does not respect op\u2019s vegan lifestyle and therefore are proving that they don\u2019t respect op either. Fam is definitely the ah and the boyfriend is ignorant at the very least.","30":"**INFO:** Do you need her to go back to work because of financial strain or do you want her to go back to work because she's asking you to do more chores around the house? \n\nIf you are covering 100% of the bills and she's a SAHM\/W then I do think she should be doing most of the household stuff. However, you do need to pitch in occasionally. Just like your \"real\" job, SAHM\/W need a break sometimes, too. You should also make sure your clothes are in the basket, you don't leave things just laying about expecting her to pick up behind you and that she gets some actual \"alone time\" (you need alone time as well). Maybe someone could watch your daughter and you two take a weekend together. \n\nIf this is just because she wants you to do more laundry\/cleaning, then a bigger picture conversation is in order. It maybe time to revisit the arrangement and she needs to be open to that if she wants things to be different. \n\nNAH, not yet. I think this is something couples with stay at home arrangements struggle with at one time or another.","31":"NTA","32":"INFO: Are you willing to share what country and languages are involved here? Is everybody the same race and similar skin tones?","33":"NAH, I can understand how they feel but your reasoning is pretty fair. They\u2019re kids and they feel left out easily though, I would say that you ought to \u201cteach\u201d them the way that you teach your daughter, by talking to them in your native language. The youngest may even pick a good bit of it up. Maybe even putting on a tv show or two from back home. Worst case scenario, they back off of the idea and you can enjoy your peace knowing that you gave it a fair shot. Best case scenario, they might show more enthusiasm for bonding with you via language than you\u2019d think. I think that having an extra shared language would be helpful for your daughter to feel closer to them too, since they\u2019re half siblings it might be a little isolating to her to only be able to talk to you in XYZ language and not the rest of her family.","34":"NTA - this is just an alienation tactic from her mom.

Going forward this could develop into an eating disorder, which you might not even realize until it\u2019s far along because they tend to hide these things (I never got caught with my ED). She may also begin to push onto others that they aren\u2019t pretty when she doesn\u2019t like them. \n\nYou had kind intentions and your daughter (and her future sibling) are obviously well-loved, good kids. This can be fixed, but it will take some serious conversations and it\u2019s a learning curve for both of you. \n\nYou may want to do your research on gentle parenting and how to best distribute a healthy form of praise\/love to your kids. People do a lot of research on this stuff and they\u2019re trying to make parenting less of a crazy fuzzy confusing subject. There\u2019s ways of praising your kid that help them develop self-love, self-confidence, and *also* help them appreciate their peers.\n\nYour best defense against this bio mom is raising a compassionate, fully supported daughter that trusts you. As someone who didn\u2019t receive much love as a kid, you\u2019re still doing well and I can tell you love her. I hope things go well for the both of you and her soon-to-be sibling.","57":"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I also noticed a number after his name that looked to be an inmate number. I opened it and it is a letter to my mom asking for bail money. $15,000. I don\u2019t know my moms exact financials but this would be a hardship, and I don\u2019t trust her to make the decision. She is elderly and easily swayed. Of course the letter states he can pay her back, has a job lined up, etc. same thing we\u2019ve heard for years.\nMy brother has been in and out of prison his whole life and is currently a heroin addict living on the street. My mom and dad spent the majority of his childhood trying to find help for his mental health disorders, with varying success. Substance abuse led him to some poor choices that landed in him prison for a gold portion of his 20s. He is now in his 40s, has somewhat showed interest in getting clean but when I press him on it, it gets less sincere. Every time he visits my mom she sends him off with money $20-100 bucks. I tell her he is just going to buy drugs with it, but he always talks her into it and she mostly obliges as this gets him to leave. I feel horrible and sad for my brother that this is the life he has, and I pray every day to not get a call that he has died from an overdose. I\u2019m hoping he can at least sober up in jail. \nI\u2019m also fed up with him taking advantage of my almost 80 year old mother. \nAm I an asshole to not tell her about the letter or that he is in jail?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

With the hours I was working, the overtime was nearly half my salary. To be clear, this was entirely voluntary, but I was young, had plenty of energy and was quite happy to work late Mon-Thurs and make some extra cash. If I had something on I would let them know I would be leaving at x time and it was never an issue.  My boss, myself and two others were frequently there until midnight getting certain projects through and, though a mere office grunt, my presence made things much easier for them as I could deal with the basic stuff like binding and proof reading while they dealt with the regulations, contracts and so on.  \n\nObviously the fact that I was suddenly costing them more than originally planned caught the attention of someone higher up.  HR called me up to their office and told me that my contract was going to be altered (illegal, btw) and I would no longer be receiving overtime or a meal allowance (after a certain time we would order dinner for everyone staying late).  \n\nSo, I went into my boss' office and informed him that I would be leaving at 17:30 precisely from now on and would not be available to work late.  Given my previous cheerful flexibility he was a bit surprised and asked if everything was okay.  I told him that HR were denying me overtime and meal allowance so I didn't feel that it made it worth me prioritizing work over my personal life.  Worth noting here that my boss was one of the top three in the organisation.  Then I went back to my desk and started counting down from ten...\n\nAt about 4, my boss goes barrelling past me at high speed and up the stairs to the next floor (where HR lurked).  I was told later there was quite a lot of shouting heard through the door.  Twenty minutes later he came back down and informed that while working longer hours was not mandatory, as I was aware, he could confirm that if I, or anyone else, did work overtime we would receive the full overtime pay and a meal allowance, and I would definitely still be getting the full bonus in a few weeks (apparently HR had offered an alternative solution of me forgoing the contractual bonus in favour of overtime.  Also illegal).  I thanked him and said I would be available until 9pm that evening then.  He then grinned and said \"let's all order dinner from the Thai place (very nice, and very expensive, it was normally my once a month payday treat if working late) I'll sign off on it\".  \n\nHe was a nightmare to work for sometimes but he did have a good heart and really looked after his people.  He also really hated HR.  I only left after he got really sick (burnout, not a surprise, but he's healthy and happily retired now, I'm glad to say) and they promoted the guy who wanted to cut my benefits (and had also pulled some other wild shit).","103":"NTA.

If not, he totally owes you. If he did, then consider this - he missed all the sleepless nights, the dirty nappies, the teething pains, the potty training, the school run, the helping with homework, the money and transport back and forward to clubs\/sports, the constant replacing clothes and shoes and coats that is all standard parenting. He wasn\u2019t there. He didn\u2019t do any of the important stuff. Now he wants to make it up to you. \n\n\nHe can clearly afford to do this or he wouldn\u2019t offer. Don\u2019t feel guilty in the slightest. He is offering an incredible boost at a time in your life where it will make a huge difference to you. Take it from someone still paying back student loans nearly 20 years later - this a a great gift. Keep the money you have saved, as there is always extra things you need, there are always  hidden expenses! Check if it comes with strings attached. If he demands your time or whatever in return for money further down the line and you don\u2019t want to give him that time, you can refuse his money safe in the knowledge that you have money saved up and will be ok. \n\n\nSeriously OP - he\u2019s your bio dad, he can clearly afford to do this and he wants to. Let him. It is good that he is willing to pay for your degree the same as his other kids. It\u2019s good that he asked you to think about it as he knows this will be a big help to you. It will make a huge difference OP. I think it says a lot about your character that you saved up for college, it means you are hard-working, independent and responsible. In my country, the fees were means tested - so your parents incomes were taken into consideration. He would\u2019ve been deemed responsible for your tuition fees here! Some kids have to go chasing after their absentee parents to get proof they can\u2019t pay. You have the opposite- he wants to pay for you. Take the gift he is giving you - it\u2019s his way of finally treating you the same as his other children. Don\u2019t feel guilty - the guilt for being like a stranger to you falls squarely on his shoulders. It\u2019s not wrong to accept help OP. \n\n\nI wish you all the best at college and in your chosen career OP!","150":"As a pharmacist, I can tell you that you\u2019re NTA. Great call for recognising that it\u2019s best if your dad stay away from opioids considering his previous addiction and not sharing your meds with them. You are not wrong that we do monitor usage of opioids. If abuse was suspected, tighter controls would be imposed. Not always the case but your doctor could reduce the amount to be supplied which could cause unnecessary anxiety around pain control.\n\nIt could be that opioid is not a suitable choice for your dad as well, for example if he is taking painkiller for nerve pain. Also, conversion between medications is not straightforward and you prevent the possibility of overdosing\/ underdosing your dad :)\n\nHow long do you have left before you are due to travel? Does he have enough time to get a supply from the pharmacy? If not, here\u2019s what he can do if he is in the UK- go to his GP and request for a prescription asap and bring it to the pharmacy. Hopefully he can get his supply in the same day.\n\nIf that\u2019s not possible, get in touch with his pharmacy if an emergency supply is possible (subject to duration of trip and type of drug).\n\nAlso, if you have not done it, check the requirements of your destination country (if overseas) about bringing controlled medications. Best of luck!","151":"I feel like this could be a bit of a communication issue though? OP specifies public which to me means strangers I don\u2019t know watching. It seems like bf tried to take that into consideration by renting the restaurant so it\u2019s only people she knows which kind of eliminates the general idea of \u201cpublic\u201d as in not a private event however by public it sounds like OP meant a large group of people even those she knows and is close\/semi close to. As a less life altering example I do not like to sing in public. I\u2019m a bad singer and I\u2019m embarrassed about it. I would not go to karaoke in a bar and sing in front of a bunch of strangers. However, and I\u2019ll use co workers as an example, all my co-workers know I\u2019m a terrible singer. They offer me lots of gentle teasing about it.

I flew across the country to be with her till the end. I have an older sister that lives with my mother. When I got here my sister said that she had a friend that would like to visit my Mom but didn't have transportation. My mom said she wanted to see him so I drove 35 minutes (1:10 roundtrip) to get this man and bring him back. When I got there I found out that his husband was also coming. Both these men were strangers to me but I did it so he could see my mom one last time. The plan we agreed on was I would take them home at 8pm because I had to pick up our other sister up from the airport and they were on the way. When the time came to leave the man and his husband had some sort of emotional meltdown and didn't want to leave my mother. I told them that I don't have time to deal with their drama because I had to get to the airport so I just left. When I made it back to Hospice with my other sister it was 1am. The two of us walked in there were now 4 people and our oldest sister in the room. Our Mom was sleeping but they were laughing,  joking and watching a loud video on someone's phone. I asked who the new people were and a woman said she and her boyfriend were here as emotional support for my Mom's friend. They just showed up to surprise him. WTF!! It is 1am and these people did not know my mother or our family. My mother has never liked many men around her so there was no way she would be ok with 3 strangers watching her on her deathbed. \n   My oldest sister didn't see anything wrong with them being here. I was so furious because that was just the most disrespectful thing I had ever seen. They were not family nor were they here to support our family. I was so furious that I told everyone to shut up and leave. I was so enraged and I don't remember exactly what I said but it was not nice. My oldest sister went out in the lobby sobbing and made a huge commotion. She went on a rant about how our Mom loved this friend and how she saved him from a bad situation. We all almost got kicked out of hospice for disturbing the other patients. Thankfully the staff agreed with me and allowed myself and the sister I just picked up to stay. Everyone else had to leave. I received a text shortly after telling me how awful I was for kicking them out. (I will post that message in the comments)\n\n   My oldest sister also said I was in the wrong because our mother wanted an Irish Wake. SHE IS NOT DEAD YET!!! You don't let strangers have a party in her hospice room at 1am!! So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Honestly, I suspect his friends are somewhat mad you let the cat out of the bag, so to speak, and maybe feel guilty for not letting him know in a nicer way, earlier. \n\nAnyways, there's not much you can do, because the problem is with him, and you aren't in a position to fix it.

My job is to sell\/ create events for kids birthday parties, adult events, etc.\n\nOur boss used to allow all the overtime we wanted. But a few weeks ago, she sent us a text saying, \"Moving forward. No one is permitted to work outside of their scheduled times. We are no longer able to have over time.\"\n\nMost of our sells are done over the phone, but sometimes people will come in-person to tour the facility and to discuss the event they want to have. These conversations can take anywhere between 30 minutes all the way up to an hour sometimes.\n\nSometimes, a customer will come in to book an event when I'm clocking out. But even if we were allowed over time, I have a life outside of work. I cannot stay 30 minutes late at a moment's notice. \n\nTonight, it was just my boss and I in the office and it was 6:59pm (I get off at 7pm) when a family walks in to book a birthday party. So I politely asked the family to take a seat and to wait one moment. Then I went into my boss's office to ask her if she would like to see the family or if she would rather I take their info and call them tomorrow morning.\n\nShe got mad and said she couldn't believe I've been, \"turning people away\" instead of staying late to help them. I apologized and told her I know we aren't allowed to work overtime any longer and I told her that I couldn't stay late tonight because I had plans (that was a lie).\n\nSo she started helping them (I heard her tell them the office was closed though) and I clocked out and got in my car.\n\nSoon after I left, she calls me to complain about what I did. I politely explain to her that I schedule my personal life around the schedule she gives us and I cannot stay late at a moment's notice because I have things going on outside of work. I also referenced the fact that she told us we are no longer allowed to go over 40 hours.\n\nShe said we'll have to change my schedule around so that I can stay late when I need to. I asked her if she was going to cut my hours (something she just did to my co-worker because she was mad at him) but she said she'll have to make my shifts different times. I told her that even if I get off at 5pm, if I have to be somewhere after work, I wont be able to stay late.\n\nShe said she has to do what's best for the company and that we'll have to have a conversation tomorrow. So I took a screenshot of the text she sent us telling us that overtime is no longer allowed.\n\nI have never been late for work and I never leave early. During our last 2 meetings she told me that I've been doing a great job. So I think it's more than reasonable that I leave when my shift is over. Those are the hours we agreed to, so those are the hours I'm prepared for.\n\nTLDR: My boss is pissed at me for not staying late today after I told her I had plans and she told us we aren't allowed to have overtime.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He can have most of his body bare but you can't? Frankly, I'm having trouble imagining a spaghetti strap top is less professional than being barefoot in the workplace which is a hygiene issue. You were as polite as the circumstance warranted. If he pulls this again, suggest he attend to his duties instead of staring at your body.","307":"Of course you're NTA, even your kid knows he was responsible for the book.   And, what's more,  he made the good decision to leaving the books at your home after this incident.   Most importantly, kudos to you for introducing them to the wonderful world of reading.   Tell the bio mom to s#@k it.","308":"NTA at least he's not a vampire.","309":"Wtf?  Nta and you need to set up a financial safety net.

Take the money.","314":"NTA. You're allergic. You were rightfully concerned about a health hazard. Making you afraid for your health is not a funny prank, and is completely unprofessional.","315":"NTA You can't help a gag reflex. Granted I feel you should have gone to your manager so they could speak quietly about it with him but it isn't up to you to protect other people's feelings, especially when you're having a physical reaction to something about him. You were being polite until he pushed it, that's about all you can do.\n\nI'm also very sensitive to scents, we've had to change up our disinfectant in the office from one brand to another because of it, and if someone has perfume on that's at all strong I will have to walk outside for a moment to breathe again. So I get where you're coming from.","316":"NTA  I read your comments and I do think it's time for her to go back to work - it sounds like your daughter is older now so there no reason for her to stay at home. BTW  I'm in the same boat, my spouse retired early(unilateral decision) and I was fine with it until he started slacking on the housework. We've had a few go around but my position is if I'm out there working full time then the person at home should be doing the work in the home","317":"NTA, never T A for this. Your life is more important than jobs and I find it strange that you would doubt that you're not justified in your choices.

I see this a lot in couples who come to me for counseling and it's completely shifted my (female) view of heterosexual modern marriages. There are definitely pretty women who think they get to remain infantile just because they're pretty. They want to be taken care of both financially and domestically. When I shift therapy to be about them learning to have empathy for how hard their male partners are working they usually throw a fit and convince their husband not to come back.","322":"NTA and it seems like your sister sucks lol","323":">He says I'm making a big deal of it when we both know I would have said yes\n\nYou know who else said yes? \"Witches\" during Medieval times after being tortured...\n\n>and that I'm being ungrateful because any other woman would kill for a bf who would go through the trouble to make a grand gesture. \n\nPlease, let the other women have him.\n\n>He said he won't consider proposing again until I apologise for embarrassing him and promise to chill out about my preferences in the future.\n\nHe's obviously prioritizing his ego before your preferences and emotional needs. What if you get married and he keeps dismissing your kids emotions? Are you sure you want to proceed? I think you dodged a bullet! \n\n**NTA By not showing up you removed and protected yourself from an emotionally stressful situation.

I hope you're doing ok, losing a pet that you've had since childhood fucking sucks.","325":"NTA:  it is not insulting to not want to overeat.  your siblings know they are wrong and are taking it out on you.  the \"you're no better than us\" is a definite sign of that.  \n\nyou have adjusted your eating habits and you feel better.  that's all there is.","326":"ESH\n\nThe entire family dynamic seems like a mess.","327":"Do you think, maybe, the length of time new posts are held in \"contest mode\" might be extended? As it is ... the vast majority of posts that make it to the front page are *long* past the current 90-minute mark for contest mode (a quick survey suggests most posts on the front page are 10+ hours old), which means people camping on \"new\" are still the most likely to benefit from the current rules in terms of top comment voting results.","328":"INFO: Who told you you needed to reapply suncream every 20 minutes?

This is the back child support he never paid.","331":"NTA for the asking because the situation does need to change.\n\nI think the problem she saw could have been how you worded it. From the edit and the infos it seems like you overwork yourself and she also works alone in the home. Explain that you know staying home and taking care of a house is a full time job and if you did only have one job, some chores things should be split between the two, however, you have 2 full time jobs and that does leave you exhausted. (She must feel like that too and that she doesn't have a partner, just like you do, sometimes asking for this sort of help is asking for the other person to be more helpful and \"a partner\" rather than someone who just lives there). Approach it from how things could change positively and even if her one job and your one job would result in lesser money the relationship and overall quality of both of your life would improve.","332":"NTA. But can you slowly win your family over to reducing their portions?   You can only do this with patience and by them not perceiving you as acting \u201cbetter\u201d than them.  Tricky\u2026","333":"NTA not your obligation to use your own ingredients or time to do the cake without payment.","334":"NTA","335":"NTA, but native Hawaiians are begging for people to stop vacationing there.

Why did your husband buy his daughter a bike?  Was it a present or a birthday?  \n\n2. Was it your daughter's birthday or a special occasion when you chose to get her a bike too?\n\n3. How do your two respective children get along?  It sounds like they are very much in each others space and rub each other like sandpaper, if that's the case it's not surprising that either of them would be so fierce about their own possessions.\n\n4. Are you four crammed into a smallish house?  Do your kids share a room?\n\nFrom what you've written I get the impression your daughter may be manipulating you.  The bike isn't her property and running to you and turning on the waterworks is concerning behaviour; you've also gone and shown her that it works and she can get you to side with her every time.\n\nYou might have considered a more tactful approach; instead reminding your daughter that it isn't her property and that she didn't want her step sister to play with her own _____ earlier in the day, followed up with Christmas\/your birhday is coming soon, would you like one as your present?\n\nLike it or not you, your husband and your respective daughters are a blended family.  You need to find a way to live together, remember you are in a parental role for both your daughter and your step daughter.  \n\nWhat message do you think your stepdaughter has taken away from this?  How would a thirteen year old girl view you and your own daughter?  How is this kind of action supposed to bring you guys together?","340":"Also.

They should be fired.","342":"Pls take the money you deserve it","343":"NTA\n\nIt's pretty clear that you just dodged what was going to be a miserable trip for you. The friend didn't want you there and husband grudgingly got you a ticket in steerage.\nHad he also purchased you tickets for the sporting events too, or did he expect you to amuse yourself in a strange city without spending money?\n\nThe only way he can make amends for this is to take you away for a first class holiday each year too. If he can afford first class with his best friend, aren't you worth it? This man doesn't value you highly enough.","344":"NTA I would be just as livid!!!

This is a cool ongoing update. Please update more. And NTA, take the money","349":"NTA, but you may get some blowback from gramps. Could be an opportunity to tell him that his granddaughter is insufferable to work with and that she treats everyone like crap because she's related to the owner...I'm  willing to bet that you're not the only person she plays princess with.\n\nWhen I was in my 20s I worked for a family-owned office furniture company that had about 100 employees. Three generations worked there, and the founder and his three sons were amazing - hard workers, honest, etc. At some point, one of the grandsons started working there, and he treated the business like it was his own. He was incredibly rude and bossy to people who had work there for decades, and he was always threatening to fire people for perceived slights. At one point, one of the warehouse guys had enough and went to the owner and told him what was going on. I'm not exactly sure what the conversation was, but for the next two weeks whenever we looked out the window we could see The Prince - as we called him - cleaning out a massive drain with a shovel.","350":"NTA but it sounds like you and your daughter are in a very unhealthy situation.

Also, depending on where you live, ignoring the firepit and letting them keep it where it is could actually give your neighbors grounds to claim part of your property as their's.

Look at it as support money owed to you.","356":"NTA.   75 people  to a dinner?

For the cake I mentioned that I would say was the size of a basketball was like $90. Then we got her a smash cake that was watermelon themed and also marble cake and this one was probably a bit bigger than a softball. That was like $30. Baking can be expensive. $120 is such a steal.

If the client excuses her behavior or sides with her, they're not worth working with, anyway.

He should have been financially supporting (at minimum) you for your whole life. He failed at that and failed even more with emotional neglect. So let him play catch up financially and help yourself be debt free that way. He will never be able to catch up emotionally.","404":"NTA.

Smegma.","410":"NTA, he can look away","411":"YTA. Your stepchildren were 9, 6 and 2 when you married their mother. Surely you want your three oldest children to have a relationship with your family as well. They will spend 1\/2, 2\/3 and 8\/9 of their childhoods with you as their stepfather, so why should they be treated as less deserving of that bond with you. The 4 year old was a baby when you came into their mother\u2019s life and a toddler when you married, soon they won\u2019t remember a time before you were part of their life. Are you saying the 4 year old should never have a relationship or be able to speak to your siblings and parents? Will they not be his\/her aunt or uncle or grandmother or grandfather too, or will you segregate the step and biological children when it comes to your family?\n\nThe part about acquiring language is only fair to a point. They are all children and still have the brain plasticity to acquire language easily now. There is no reason you can\u2019t teach them a few basic words and a few simple phrases and just use those often where they fit, with English remaining your normal language. Then add a little more every month or when opportunity presents. You don\u2019t need to have lengthy lessons with them or explain entire grammatical systems, you just need to do enough to make them feel like it is important to you to share your language with them too. Down the road this can be supplemented with more formal paid tutoring but for now this isn\u2019t about LOTE fluency, it is about treating your young stepchildren like your children.\n\nI only spoke English and grew up in an English speaking country but had younger cousins who had both parents of the background my mother is (I do not speak her first four languages). The only phrases and vocabulary I know now as an adult are the phrases, questions, and vocabulary  used regularly with a small child that my aunt taught me specifically for my 1-2 year old cousins when I was a tween. The limited amount I was taught was easy to retain long beyond the couple years of those phrases actually being used by or around me because they were used in day-to-day life. I remember absolutely nothing of the Mandarin Chinese I was taught in school several years later and I did very well at the time in class.\n\nLastly, the children are upset and it is making them feel less important to you so why not teach them a little just for the purpose of showing love. You say they are \u201cobviously feeling threatened\u201d and yet you are actively and knowingly doing something to create that sense of threat to their position. It wasn\u2019t entirely inevitable that the older children would see their new sibling as a threat, that is determined by choices you and their mother make. You are creating distance between the three older children and their baby sister, distance that doesn\u2019t need to exist.\n\nSeriously, have you at least taught the three eldest how to count 1-10, say yes\/no\/hello\/goodbye\/please\/thank you, everyday food and drinks, cat\/dog\/monkey\/bird\/fish\/whatever their favourite animals are, bed\/room\/home\/sun\/moon and eat\/drink\/stop\/sleep\/walk\/run\/sit?\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t see your edit. My last question remains though.\nI highly doubt a 4 and 6 year old are asking for more structured lessons from you and then imagining something you aren\u2019t capable of. What they are asking for is more effort. More than one phrase every 6 months. Is 15 minutes twice a week to learn words of a theme something you could do? Teach them \u201ctime for bed\u201d and \u201cgo brush your teeth\u201d and they have a couple phrases in your language that you can use with them every single day. For vocab family goes to the park one day, teach them grass\/tree\/swing\/slide\/friend\/dog later that day after dinner. Next week you go to the beach so the \u2018lesson\u2019 is beach\/sand\/ocean\/fish\/sun\/towel. Family pizza making night teach them dough or bread\/cheese\/meat\/tomato\/mushroom\/capsicum and say them over and over while the kids cook with you.","412":"NTA but take the money, its the bare minimum that he legally as a father should  have given you if you add it all up throughout the years.

That\u2019s a huge labor intensive cake and you should definitely be paid a small amount for making it. $120 is more than fair and an incredible deal for your mom\u2019s company. I\u2019m guessing the ingredients would be purchased by your mom too but all together she\u2019d be saving the company a lot on catering. That sized cake is usually very pricey, maybe suggest your mom shop around before she balks at your price. If she\u2019s still insistent that you work for free just say no.","417":"Yikes. I'm kind of torn on my judgement here. If she's homeschooling because you both feel that's best, then when is she supposed to work? Or does she have time to do a part time work from home job?

Less expensive house or cars or anything?\n\nI'm not saying you need to do a lot, but maybe she's feeling neglected and it's coming out as \"You don't cook a meal or wash a dish for me.\" If you're working 80 hours a week, when do you have time for her, you know? \n\nI guess I'm going with NAH. I don't see her as using you for a meal ticket, or you as an AH of a husband. I see two people who somehow ended up in a life that doesn't allow for a lot of extra anything other than work and taking care of a kid and a house. That's not sustainable, or very fun.

So... ESH.*\n\nPlease, don't misunderstand. This isn't the kind of joke I particularly like, either. I have a lot of animals, myself, and a joke like this would make me scared the dogs would tear that cat apart, or that the strange cat will attack MY cat, or something involving the kids. Like I would have a higher stress level, but I would probably let it go afterwards. \n\n**That's ME. I am not YOU.** I can only really speak for myself, and I wasn't there, so it could have been more stressful that I can absorb from the posting. I know that. I respect that.\n\nI get you're allergic, and having a stray in the house would have sucked majorly; I acknowledge that it would have been a terrible inconvenience and an expensive one if you had to hire cleaners to be sure the dander was gone, etc. However, there wasn't really a cat, so there really wasn't any damage done, at least from where I sit.\n\n**From my Perspective:** You said they seemed friendly, and the joking aspect was probably an extension of that. I highly doubt it was done with malice. They didn't release an actual cat into the house. They didn't leave you thinking one was inside to stress over. It's the kind of thing my FIL would do: playful and maybe annoying, but no real harm done. While it wasn't a GOOD joke, it was still people just trying to lighten a day with a little humor. There's no accounting for bad humor.","440":"NTA I\u2019ve done hospice care for family members and my pets. Both are brutally draining.

So it\u2019s almost like just spending an extra bit of time with them and also giving them medicine.\n\nWith pets it\u2019s hard because you can\u2019t really explain to them what\u2019s happening.

They never taught me about good nutrition, portion sizes, and the only exercise I got was gym class. So of course, I was used to all this, right? Especially since a lot of my friends were the same.\n\nWhen I went to college I was exposed to a lot of new things, and I learned quickly that my family\u2019s habits weren\u2019t healthy. For years they always said the weight was genetic. When I\u2019d go to lunch with my friend group at the dining hall I started noticing that my portion sizes were huge against theirs. I cut down my portions and I\u2019d join them doing Yoga and stuff.\n\nNaturally I ended up losing some weight. Like size 22 to tight size 12. I really like the way I look, you can see my collarbones!. But I ended up having to go back home during summer break and I\u2019ve been surprised at just how different I feel from my family. When we would order pizzas 2 years ago we\u2019d basically each get our own and it would be gone that night. We had pizza night when I got home and I ate 2 slices and that was it.\n\nLast week my mom made her special lasagna. I made a size salad to go with it. She always plates the meals and then sets the big dish in the middle so we can have more. Well the piece she gave me was way too big. So I cut it in half and served myself more salad.\n\nMy sister immediately got on my case about how rude that was to Mom because she worked hard on the lasagna. I said that I couldn\u2019t eat that much food in one sitting and she scoffed and said that didn\u2019t used to be a problem. I said yes but if you can\u2019t tell, things have changed a little.\n\nShe got in my face and said that I brought my college bullshit home with me and I should have left it at the door and ate like a normal person. I told her that I was eating like a normal person, that everyone I knew at school eats like this and that we\u2019re the abnormality. That\u2019s it\u2019s not normal to be so stuffed at the table you\u2019re in pain.\n\nMy brother chimed in saying that I\u2019d just gain the weight back so stop pretending I\u2019m better than they are. But I don\u2019t think I am at all. I\u2019m no better than anyone. But I also don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong for sticking to smaller portions instead of being stuffed all the time.

To some people that kind of small deception indicates a person who is willing to also be deceptive in more serious ways.","651":"NTA, just because someone is terminally ill it doesn't give them the right to be an asshole","652":"Nta and I\u2019d suggest you take this red flag and not marry it","653":"NTA\n\nHe lost the book. He has to pay the fee. (A nominal one at that) it\u2019s an important lesson.\n\nClearly his mum could stand to learn it too.","654":"I was already thinking NTA, but the details in your edit really clinch it. You are not asking them to live in fear of an aggressive, hungry dog. All dogs always look like they want your food; that doesn't mean they're underfed. Also no dog should ever need to be \"appeased\" with food. The reality is that most pet dogs are extremely overfed, to the point that people mistakenly think a healthy dog looks underweight. \n\nEven if this behavior was coming from a place of genuine concern that your dog was hungry, feeding him from the table will harm his health *and* his behavior. He keeps begging because he's rewarded for it. Also- salads? If those salads happen to contain a tomato they could literally kill your dog.","655":"What your boss meant was \u201cno more paid overtime, unpaid overtime is fine\u201d - silly OP for not realising this \/s","656":"YTA, those are the job duties,  if you cannot manage to do them you need to vacate the job so someone qualified can do it.  They don't need to waste any money on a useless employee crying in front of customers as well as in the back over doing expected job related tasks.","657":"NTA.

In Florida it's two years so X=24 months).\n\nIf you like the job & usually like her, you can suggest a flex schedule i.e. some variation on 9 hours days 4 days a week + 4 hours the 5th leaving someone else to cover the remaining 4+ hours of the 5th day.  Or a staggered shift: someone could come in 2 hours later & leave 2 hours later.\n\nIf you get the \"team player\" speech though start looking for work.  Nothing good ever came of management asking people to stay late when they themselves won't.","662":"Very obviously NTA. Does he have a kink for shoulders or what?

I don\u2019t know my moms exact financials but this would be a hardship, and I don\u2019t trust her to make the decision. She is elderly and easily swayed.

My mom and dad spent the majority of his childhood trying to find help for his mental health disorders, with varying success. Substance abuse led him to some poor choices that landed in him prison for a gold portion of his 20s. He is now in his 40s, has somewhat showed interest in getting clean but when I press him on it, it gets less sincere. Every time he visits my mom she sends him off with money $20-100 bucks. I tell her he is just going to buy drugs with it, but he always talks her into it and she mostly obliges as this gets him to leave. I feel horrible and sad for my brother that this is the life he has, and I pray every day to not get a call that he has died from an overdose.

With the hours I was working, the overtime was nearly half my salary. To be clear, this was entirely voluntary, but I was young, had plenty of energy and was quite happy to work late Mon-Thurs and make some extra cash. If I had something on I would let them know I would be leaving at x time and it was never an issue.  My boss, myself and two others were frequently there until midnight getting certain projects through and, though a mere office grunt, my presence made things much easier for them as I could deal with the basic stuff like binding and proof reading while they dealt with the regulations, contracts and so on.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Obviously the fact that I was suddenly costing them more than originally planned caught the attention of someone higher up.  HR called me up to their office and told me that my contract was going to be altered (illegal, btw) and I would no longer be receiving overtime or a meal allowance (after a certain time we would order dinner for everyone staying late).  <\/p>\n\n<p>So, I went into my boss&#39; office and informed him that I would be leaving at 17:30 precisely from now on and would not be available to work late.  Given my previous cheerful flexibility he was a bit surprised and asked if everything was okay.  I told him that HR were denying me overtime and meal allowance so I didn&#39;t feel that it made it worth me prioritizing work over my personal life.  Worth noting here that my boss was one of the top three in the organisation.  Then I went back to my desk and started counting down from ten...<\/p>\n\n<p>At about 4, my boss goes barrelling past me at high speed and up the stairs to the next floor (where HR lurked).  I was told later there was quite a lot of shouting heard through the door.  Twenty minutes later he came back down and informed that while working longer hours was not mandatory, as I was aware, he could confirm that if I, or anyone else, did work overtime we would receive the full overtime pay and a meal allowance, and I would definitely still be getting the full bonus in a few weeks (apparently HR had offered an alternative solution of me forgoing the contractual bonus in favour of overtime.  Also illegal).  I thanked him and said I would be available until 9pm that evening then.  He then grinned and said &quot;let&#39;s all order dinner from the Thai place (very nice, and very expensive, it was normally my once a month payday treat if working late) I&#39;ll sign off on it&quot;.  <\/p>\n\n<p>He was a nightmare to work for sometimes but he did have a good heart and really looked after his people.  He also really hated HR.  I only left after he got really sick (burnout, not a surprise, but he&#39;s healthy and happily retired now, I&#39;m glad to say) and they promoted the guy who wanted to cut my benefits (and had also pulled some other wild shit).<\/p>\n<\/div>","103":"<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA.

The disrespect is mind blowing.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m allergic to a protein in cows milk and I&#39;ve had someone test me by giving me normal milk instead of my usual barista oat milk (after a while you actually forget the taste so I couldn&#39;t tell immediately).

I get you and you did nothing wrong.<\/p>\n<\/div>","146":"<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA I completely understand why you said and why you wanted her to know that she is beautiful no matter the beauty standards. My daughter is brown and I tell her all the time how lucky she is to have such beautiful dark skin and that people pay to have a tan. Colorism is a thing in my culture unfortunately and I remind her all the time how beautiful her skin is. Mom is purposely trying to twist your words and turn her against the baby. Gather evidence and use it in court before things get worse.<\/p>\n<\/div>","147":"<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA for accepting your bio-dad&#39;s offer to pay for college. Honestly, this is the absolute LEAST he could do, considering. I think it is awesome that you were able to save enough to cover your own tuition - that is not easy to do. Now you can accept this money - which is a tiny, tiny consolation given how your dad let you down - and save your money for something else.<\/p>\n<\/div>","148":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I am not going to say you&#39;re right. I probably would make my son walk it. But, with him just getting out of the hospital,  I would do what my mom used to do when we were fighting on the way to school. She would drop is off on the sidewalk, turn on her hazard lights and make us walk for a mile while she drove right along beside us. At first, we thought it was to taunt us and make us a spectacle,  but the we realized that she was doing it to make sure we were all right.<\/p>\n<\/div>","149":"<div class=\"md\"><p>YWNBTA \/ NTA<\/p>\n\n<p>Did he pay child support when you were growing up? If not, he totally owes you. If he did, then consider this - he missed all the sleepless nights, the dirty nappies, the teething pains, the potty training, the school run, the helping with homework, the money and transport back and forward to clubs\/sports, the constant replacing clothes and shoes and coats that is all standard parenting. He wasn\u2019t there. He didn\u2019t do any of the important stuff. Now he wants to make it up to you. <\/p>\n\n<p>He can clearly afford to do this or he wouldn\u2019t offer. Don\u2019t feel guilty in the slightest. He is offering an incredible boost at a time in your life where it will make a huge difference to you. Take it from someone still paying back student loans nearly 20 years later - this a a great gift. Keep the money you have saved, as there is always extra things you need, there are always  hidden expenses! Check if it comes with strings attached. If he demands your time or whatever in return for money further down the line and you don\u2019t want to give him that time, you can refuse his money safe in the knowledge that you have money saved up and will be ok. <\/p>\n\n<p>Seriously OP - he\u2019s your bio dad, he can clearly afford to do this and he wants to. Let him. It is good that he is willing to pay for your degree the same as his other kids. It\u2019s good that he asked you to think about it as he knows this will be a big help to you. It will make a huge difference OP. I think it says a lot about your character that you saved up for college, it means you are hard-working, independent and responsible. In my country, the fees were means tested - so your parents incomes were taken into consideration. He would\u2019ve been deemed responsible for your tuition fees here! Some kids have to go chasing after their absentee parents to get proof they can\u2019t pay. You have the opposite- he wants to pay for you. Take the gift he is giving you - it\u2019s his way of finally treating you the same as his other children. Don\u2019t feel guilty - the guilt for being like a stranger to you falls squarely on his shoulders. It\u2019s not wrong to accept help OP. <\/p>\n\n<p>I wish you all the best at college and in your chosen career OP!<\/p>\n<\/div>","150":"<div class=\"md\"><p>As a pharmacist, I can tell you that you\u2019re NTA. Great call for recognising that it\u2019s best if your dad stay away from opioids considering his previous addiction and not sharing your meds with them. You are not wrong that we do monitor usage of opioids. If abuse was suspected, tighter controls would be imposed. Not always the case but your doctor could reduce the amount to be supplied which could cause unnecessary anxiety around pain control.<\/p>\n\n<p>It could be that opioid is not a suitable choice for your dad as well, for example if he is taking painkiller for nerve pain. Also, conversion between medications is not straightforward and you prevent the possibility of overdosing\/ underdosing your dad :)<\/p>\n\n<p>How long do you have left before you are due to travel? Does he have enough time to get a supply from the pharmacy? If not, here\u2019s what he can do if he is in the UK- go to his GP and request for a prescription asap and bring it to the pharmacy. Hopefully he can get his supply in the same day.<\/p>\n\n<p>If that\u2019s not possible, get in touch with his pharmacy if an emergency supply is possible (subject to duration of trip and type of drug).<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, if you have not done it, check the requirements of your destination country (if overseas) about bringing controlled medications.

As a less life altering example I do not like to sing in public. I\u2019m a bad singer and I\u2019m embarrassed about it. I would not go to karaoke in a bar and sing in front of a bunch of strangers. However, and I\u2019ll use co workers as an example, all my co-workers know I\u2019m a terrible singer. They offer me lots of gentle teasing about it.

I flew across the country to be with her till the end. I have an older sister that lives with my mother. When I got here my sister said that she had a friend that would like to visit my Mom but didn&#39;t have transportation. My mom said she wanted to see him so I drove 35 minutes (1:10 roundtrip) to get this man and bring him back. When I got there I found out that his husband was also coming. Both these men were strangers to me but I did it so he could see my mom one last time. The plan we agreed on was I would take them home at 8pm because I had to pick up our other sister up from the airport and they were on the way. When the time came to leave the man and his husband had some sort of emotional meltdown and didn&#39;t want to leave my mother. I told them that I don&#39;t have time to deal with their drama because I had to get to the airport so I just left. When I made it back to Hospice with my other sister it was 1am. The two of us walked in there were now 4 people and our oldest sister in the room. Our Mom was sleeping but they were laughing,  joking and watching a loud video on someone&#39;s phone. I asked who the new people were and a woman said she and her boyfriend were here as emotional support for my Mom&#39;s friend. They just showed up to surprise him. WTF!! It is 1am and these people did not know my mother or our family. My mother has never liked many men around her so there was no way she would be ok with 3 strangers watching her on her deathbed. \n   My oldest sister didn&#39;t see anything wrong with them being here. I was so furious because that was just the most disrespectful thing I had ever seen. They were not family nor were they here to support our family. I was so furious that I told everyone to shut up and leave. I was so enraged and I don&#39;t remember exactly what I said but it was not nice. My oldest sister went out in the lobby sobbing and made a huge commotion. She went on a rant about how our Mom loved this friend and how she saved him from a bad situation. We all almost got kicked out of hospice for disturbing the other patients. Thankfully the staff agreed with me and allowed myself and the sister I just picked up to stay. Everyone else had to leave. I received a text shortly after telling me how awful I was for kicking them out. (I will post that message in the comments)<\/p>\n\n<p>My oldest sister also said I was in the wrong because our mother wanted an Irish Wake. SHE IS NOT DEAD YET!!! You don&#39;t let strangers have a party in her hospice room at 1am!! So AITA?<\/p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

While your relationship and communication needs a lot of work, you did right by your daughter. <\/p>\n\n<p>Of course life is not always fair and some people get things others do not, this situation is different. My ex step dad bought my step sister a very nice expensive bike just because. I was happy for her, but felt left out. For my birthday I asked for a bike.

My job is to sell\/ create events for kids birthday parties, adult events, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our boss used to allow all the overtime we wanted. But a few weeks ago, she sent us a text saying, &quot;Moving forward. No one is permitted to work outside of their scheduled times. We are no longer able to have over time.&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p>Most of our sells are done over the phone, but sometimes people will come in-person to tour the facility and to discuss the event they want to have. These conversations can take anywhere between 30 minutes all the way up to an hour sometimes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, a customer will come in to book an event when I&#39;m clocking out. But even if we were allowed over time, I have a life outside of work. I cannot stay 30 minutes late at a moment&#39;s notice. <\/p>\n\n<p>Tonight, it was just my boss and I in the office and it was 6:59pm (I get off at 7pm) when a family walks in to book a birthday party. So I politely asked the family to take a seat and to wait one moment. Then I went into my boss&#39;s office to ask her if she would like to see the family or if she would rather I take their info and call them tomorrow morning.<\/p>\n\n<p>She got mad and said she couldn&#39;t believe I&#39;ve been, &quot;turning people away&quot; instead of staying late to help them. I apologized and told her I know we aren&#39;t allowed to work overtime any longer and I told her that I couldn&#39;t stay late tonight because I had plans (that was a lie).<\/p>\n\n<p>So she started helping them (I heard her tell them the office was closed though) and I clocked out and got in my car.<\/p>\n\n<p>Soon after I left, she calls me to complain about what I did. I politely explain to her that I schedule my personal life around the schedule she gives us and I cannot stay late at a moment&#39;s notice because I have things going on outside of work. I also referenced the fact that she told us we are no longer allowed to go over 40 hours.<\/p>\n\n<p>She said we&#39;ll have to change my schedule around so that I can stay late when I need to. I asked her if she was going to cut my hours (something she just did to my co-worker because she was mad at him) but she said she&#39;ll have to make my shifts different times. I told her that even if I get off at 5pm, if I have to be somewhere after work, I wont be able to stay late.<\/p>\n\n<p>She said she has to do what&#39;s best for the company and that we&#39;ll have to have a conversation tomorrow. So I took a screenshot of the text she sent us telling us that overtime is no longer allowed.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have never been late for work and I never leave early. During our last 2 meetings she told me that I&#39;ve been doing a great job. So I think it&#39;s more than reasonable that I leave when my shift is over. Those are the hours we agreed to, so those are the hours I&#39;m prepared for.<\/p>\n\n<p>TLDR: My boss is pissed at me for not staying late today after I told her I had plans and she told us we aren&#39;t allowed to have overtime.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He was incredibly rude and bossy to people who had work there for decades, and he was always threatening to fire people for perceived slights. At one point, one of the warehouse guys had enough and went to the owner and told him what was going on.

Surely you want your three oldest children to have a relationship with your family as well. They will spend 1\/2, 2\/3 and 8\/9 of their childhoods with you as their stepfather, so why should they be treated as less deserving of that bond with you. The 4 year old was a baby when you came into their mother\u2019s life and a toddler when you married, soon they won\u2019t remember a time before you were part of their life. Are you saying the 4 year old should never have a relationship or be able to speak to your siblings and parents? Will they not be his\/her aunt or uncle or grandmother or grandfather too, or will you segregate the step and biological children when it comes to your family?<\/p>\n\n<p>The part about acquiring language is only fair to a point. They are all children and still have the brain plasticity to acquire language easily now. There is no reason you can\u2019t teach them a few basic words and a few simple phrases and just use those often where they fit, with English remaining your normal language. Then add a little more every month or when opportunity presents. You don\u2019t need to have lengthy lessons with them or explain entire grammatical systems, you just need to do enough to make them feel like it is important to you to share your language with them too. Down the road this can be supplemented with more formal paid tutoring but for now this isn\u2019t about LOTE fluency, it is about treating your young stepchildren like your children.<\/p>\n\n<p>I only spoke English and grew up in an English speaking country but had younger cousins who had both parents of the background my mother is (I do not speak her first four languages). The only phrases and vocabulary I know now as an adult are the phrases, questions, and vocabulary  used regularly with a small child that my aunt taught me specifically for my 1-2 year old cousins when I was a tween. The limited amount I was taught was easy to retain long beyond the couple years of those phrases actually being used by or around me because they were used in day-to-day life. I remember absolutely nothing of the Mandarin Chinese I was taught in school several years later and I did very well at the time in class.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lastly, the children are upset and it is making them feel less important to you so why not teach them a little just for the purpose of showing love. You say they are \u201cobviously feeling threatened\u201d and yet you are actively and knowingly doing something to create that sense of threat to their position. It wasn\u2019t entirely inevitable that the older children would see their new sibling as a threat, that is determined by choices you and their mother make. You are creating distance between the three older children and their baby sister, distance that doesn\u2019t need to exist.<\/p>\n\n<p>Seriously, have you at least taught the three eldest how to count 1-10, say yes\/no\/hello\/goodbye\/please\/thank you, everyday food and drinks, cat\/dog\/monkey\/bird\/fish\/whatever their favourite animals are, bed\/room\/home\/sun\/moon and eat\/drink\/stop\/sleep\/walk\/run\/sit?<\/p>\n\n<p>Edit: I didn\u2019t see your edit. My last question remains though.\nI highly doubt a 4 and 6 year old are asking for more structured lessons from you and then imagining something you aren\u2019t capable of. What they are asking for is more effort. More than one phrase every 6 months. Is 15 minutes twice a week to learn words of a theme something you could do? Teach them \u201ctime for bed\u201d and \u201cgo brush your teeth\u201d and they have a couple phrases in your language that you can use with them every single day. For vocab family goes to the park one day, teach them grass\/tree\/swing\/slide\/friend\/dog later that day after dinner. Next week you go to the beach so the \u2018lesson\u2019 is beach\/sand\/ocean\/fish\/sun\/towel. Family pizza making night teach them dough or bread\/cheese\/meat\/tomato\/mushroom\/capsicum and say them over and over while the kids cook with you.<\/p>\n<\/div>","412":"<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA but take the money, its the bare minimum that he legally as a father should  have given you if you add it all up throughout the years.

I don&#39;t think a predominantly harmless joke is worth endangering someone&#39;s job for, but at this point, what&#39;s done is done. The fact you&#39;re asking IYTA can be interpreted as a little nagging guilt. So... ESH.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Please, don&#39;t misunderstand. This isn&#39;t the kind of joke I particularly like, either. I have a lot of animals, myself, and a joke like this would make me scared the dogs would tear that cat apart, or that the strange cat will attack MY cat, or something involving the kids.

I highly doubt it was done with malice. They didn&#39;t release an actual cat into the house. They didn&#39;t leave you thinking one was inside to stress over. It&#39;s the kind of thing my FIL would do: playful and maybe annoying, but no real harm done. While it wasn&#39;t a GOOD joke, it was still people just trying to lighten a day with a little humor.

So it\u2019s almost like just spending an extra bit of time with them and also giving them medicine.<\/p>\n\n<p>With pets it\u2019s hard because you can\u2019t really explain to them what\u2019s happening.

They never taught me about good nutrition, portion sizes, and the only exercise I got was gym class. So of course, I was used to all this, right? Especially since a lot of my friends were the same.<\/p>\n\n<p>When I went to college I was exposed to a lot of new things, and I learned quickly that my family\u2019s habits weren\u2019t healthy. For years they always said the weight was genetic. When I\u2019d go to lunch with my friend group at the dining hall I started noticing that my portion sizes were huge against theirs. I cut down my portions and I\u2019d join them doing Yoga and stuff.<\/p>\n\n<p>Naturally I ended up losing some weight. Like size 22 to tight size 12. I really like the way I look, you can see my collarbones!. But I ended up having to go back home during summer break and I\u2019ve been surprised at just how different I feel from my family. When we would order pizzas 2 years ago we\u2019d basically each get our own and it would be gone that night. We had pizza night when I got home and I ate 2 slices and that was it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Last week my mom made her special lasagna. I made a size salad to go with it. She always plates the meals and then sets the big dish in the middle so we can have more. Well the piece she gave me was way too big. So I cut it in half and served myself more salad.<\/p>\n\n<p>My sister immediately got on my case about how rude that was to Mom because she worked hard on the lasagna. I said that I couldn\u2019t eat that much food in one sitting and she scoffed and said that didn\u2019t used to be a problem. I said yes but if you can\u2019t tell, things have changed a little.<\/p>\n\n<p>She got in my face and said that I brought my college bullshit home with me and I should have left it at the door and ate like a normal person.

My husband had some work he needed to do on my first official day of living in Italy so he asked his younger brother and his other brother\u2019s wife to show me around. <\/p>\n\n<p>His brother\u2019s wife is lovely but his younger brother is such an arrogant condescending dick. Our families have known and worked with each other for years but I don\u2019t know him very well and I wasn\u2019t aware there was some weird competition going on between our families. We had lunch with his cousins and the entire time they were criticising my brother. When I tried to defend him, my younger brother-in-law told me I was a little girl so I didn\u2019t understand these things. I\u2019m older than him and he\u2019s barely an adult so I was really angry he said that to me.<\/p>\n\n<p>I told him I was going home because he was a prick and he told me I couldn\u2019t as my husband told him I needed to stay with him until he came home and so that\u2019s what I was going to do. His brother\u2019s wife tried to salvage the situation by telling me to ignore him and suggesting we went shopping. <\/p>\n\n<p>Even the way he agreed to shopping was annoying so I was very annoyed by the time I decided to use the crowd to ditch them and leave. <\/p>\n\n<p>I ended up going to meet my husband and his other brother. My husband was upset I was alone and wanted to know what happened. <\/p>\n\n<p>My husband blew up at his younger brother, who was already upset that I left the way I did and made them waste time searching for me, when he saw him. He kept insisting I had issues and it wasn\u2019t his fault that I didn\u2019t understand that my loyalties should be to my husband now. I told him he was just angry that a little girl bested him which made him even angrier.<\/p>\n\n<p>AITA<\/p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Maybe this is the base dress and you can get a little alteration\/detail changed, both because it sounds like you feel that it&#39;s bringing forth something from your previous wedding and like you&#39;re worried that others will perceive it that way.
